//Star League Tigers are deeply motivated to eat all cows of Farmer John, including always 
//troublemaker Bessie - cause of all the USACO problems. Tigers â„–007 got the plans of Farmer 
//John's farm. They found that Farmer John's farm consists of exactly 3 rectangles.  

//Tigers know that the population ratio of the FJ's farm is 1 cow/unit square. And they 
//want make a team of tigers such that each tiger will eat one cow.

//Please help tigers to find how many tigers will be in the team.  

//INPUT FORMAT:
//  Input consists of 3 lines. 
//  Each line contains four space-separated integers: x1 y1 x2 y2, where 
//     (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) are the coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right 
//     corners of one rectangles
//  All coordinates are in the range -10000 to +10000.

//OUTPUT FORMAT:
//  Please output the total combined area of 3 rectangles. 

//SAMPLE INPUT:
//1 0 4 7
//8 4 9 8
//2 4 5 5

//SAMPLE OUTPUT:
//26
